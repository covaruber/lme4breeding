      * [r_1.0.1] Initial release bringing the best ideas of sommer into the powerful horse of Douglas Bates' and team lme4.

      * [r_1.0.21] The eigen decomposition has been improved by adding an outlier coefficient to avoid overshooting.
      * [r_1.0.22] The eigen decomposition now allows multiple random effects although we still need balanced data to make it work.
      * [r_1.0.31] Warning messages removed when using the lFormula function

      * [r_1.0.40] 'simage' function added for sparsity plots and better documentation of GxE models

      * [r_1.0.60] enhanced the 'start' and 'returnMod' arguments to do prediction of unobserved levels
      * [r_1.0.60] corrected the optimizer selection in glms 
      * [r_1.0.60] minor modifications to getMME function

      * [r_1.0.70] updated CRAN version

2025-12-27 Giovanny Covarrubias Pazaran <cova_ruber@live.com.mx>

      * [r_1.0.80] we moved to build the U matrix (n x n) using the kronecker product to speed up computations in big models
      * [r_1.0.80] closure issue fixed by using the native match.call() and just changing from lmer/glmer to lFormula/glFormula
      * [r_1.0.80] proper specification of the modular functions from lme4
      * [r_1.0.80] added balanceData function
      * [r_1.0.80] added a new dataset DT_big to show how to fit big genomic models

** TO DO

+ do not store Utn
+ check why the rotation is not working properly when we have more than one random effect
